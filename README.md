# laravel-vue-workshop

This is the code of my workshop creating a simple Laravel and Vue.js project, presented for the first time on [PHP Community Summit 2018](http://eventos.locaweb.com.br/proximos-eventos/php-community-summit-2018/).

It shows the Laravel and Vue.js basics, and a how to implement an users CRUD, but without things like authentication due to the limited workshop time.

This project is intented to people who has some knowledge in PHP and JavaScript, trying to don't use advanced things of each language.
